Feature: Source Content Overrrite (Regression)
  In order to prove that XLIFF imports do not overwrite source content
  Site administrators should be able to
  Import XLIFF translations through the XLIFF portal for existing content without affecting source content

  Background: Set up a translation set
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administer entity xliff,translate content,bypass node access,bypass workbench moderation" permissions
    And "page" content:
      | title              | body                    | language | promote |
      | English page title | English page body text. | en       | 1       |
    When I am on the homepage
    And follow "English page title"
    And I click "Translate"
    And I click "add translation"
    And I fill in "French page title" for "title"
    And I press "Save"

  Scenario: Import over existing translation set (focus on field collections)
    When I click "Translate"
    And I click "English page title"
    And I click "New draft"
    And I press "Save"
    And I click "New draft"
    And I fill in "English field collection" for "field_field_collection[en][0][field_long_text][und][0][value]"
    And I press "Save"
    And I click "XLIFF"
    And I attach a "fr" translation of this "English" node
